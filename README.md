* Setup the AWS infrastructure for a Retool system that consisted in several ECS tasks, a backend database in a way that is compliant with security requirements (like the access through corporate VPN only) according to requirements. 
* Database design and implementation with Postgres according to functional requirements, reviews, integration and sync across environments.
* Use of infrastructure as code techniques using terraform + atlantis following best practices given by the SRE team.
* Implementation of features that reduces the network transfer outside AWS by 50+% by applying user friendly work flows. (query optimization, pagination, caching, among others)
* Database monitoring using the AWS capabilities/dashboard.
* Retool application development based on functional and nonfunctional requirements. This includes custom components that were required for very specific business needs. In which already created components could not be used.
* Participated in multiple user groups sessions to go over the changes, upcoming features and proposals, giving and receiving feedback and demoing the current state of the system
* Worked in several observability features using Grafana. 5+ dashboards with ~8 charts each based on the collected logs that gives a better visibility of what is happening with the different systems in near real time to help the support process, as well as getting notified about possible issues currently happening.
* Multiple Retool configuration adjustments including migrations/upgrades and integrations with external systems like GitHub or security features like Single Sign On from Azure.
* Technical documentation and user guides writing, covering most popular use cases and relevant building blocks.
* REST API implementation using .NET 6 using best practices on code maintainability and testability.
* User test definitions using ZScaler tool

## (08-2016 – 11-2022) Intel, Heredia, Costa Rica
### _Software Developer Engineer_

*  Automated validation processes across multiple systems and services to speed delivery speed and quality. This allowed the team to find escapees while doing changes and stop releases to customers.
* Served as an enabler for people inside and outside the team/organization by helping them on activities that will benefit/improve their work, the department and Intel in general.
* Driven the design activities for general purpose solutions, stakeholders, timelines definition and other management/client relevant decisions that will define the development activities for the team.
* Developed backend services to support front-end applications and automation scripts and their business needs using ASP.NET core and other technologies.
* Helped the adoption process from multiple teams in new systems so they can easily use the new development in less time than initially required. All this by creating and debugging client scripts that connect to the new systems and also solving questions from customers.
* Developed front-end capabilities using Angular technologies based on previous defined/discussed needs, set the definition of done and followed the process from initial implementation to final deployment.
* Given customer support that implies working with clients and solving their issues with the system and with the inputs provided.
* Designed software solutions end to end (from requirements gathering to production release). Some of the efforts were a new module in a legacy system, a new script or even a new service.
* Implemented Azure Dev-ops pipelines to automate releases to cloud infrastructure and scheduled tasks, validated them and certified that the process is working.
* Implementing hotfix and new capabilities in legacy tools to support day to day business needs. From errors found to features that were required due to business changes. Most of these features helped reduce an important amount of time in the end user activities.
* Fulfilled security requirements given by the IT department on the existing tooling including legacy.
* Redesigning and/or implementation of current legacy code to reduce the technical debt. Activities were from updating the framework to refactoring a set of classes.
* Troubleshoot unknown new issues to improve existing application’s stability.
* Response to issues that block normal operations of the system in a microservice architecture, from errors triggered by the system itself to problems caused by changes in the platform where those technologies reside. Most of them required querying application insights from Azure.
* Resolution on automated validation processes of the tooling used that failed due to platform changes. For example, a E2E test project had problems because of the build pack used + disk size configured.
* Implemented ETL jobs for synchronizing data and reporting activities using SQL Server Integration Services and SQL server. Some of the efforts required adding extra Power BI development activities.
* Coordinated daily stand-up meetings for the team following agile methodologies.
* Managed business communication with stakeholder around the globe (USA, Israel, Asia, India, among others)
* Added improvements on existing SQL Queries that were slowing down tools normal operations, some of the enhancements were done by updating the existing code (stored procedure) but also fixes on the database structure (indexes, fragmentation, etc.)
