# Work Experience

## (11-2022 – Present) Growth Acceleration Partners
### _Software Developer Engineer_

- Worked with AWS infrastructure definition and creation using infrastructure as code techniques. This varies from ECS Tasks, Databases, Security Groups, S3 Buckets or Kafka Topics to deployment charts (Deployments, Cronjobs, Secrets, etc)
- Driven the database design, definition and implementation using Postgres according to given requirements, reviews, integration and sync across environments. This also includes the initial deployment of the infrastructure through terraform.
- Addressed requests from SRE about deployments and implementations made in order for the system to be compliant from a security perspective and best practices.
- Retool application development based on functional and nonfunctional requirements. This includes custom components that were required for very specific business needs. In which already created components could not be used. This also includes performance requirements that were solved through caching and lazy loading.
- Participated in multiple user groups sessions (with stakeholders and final users) to go over the changes, upcoming features and proposals, giving and receiving feedback and demoing the current state of the system.
- Worked in several observability features using Grafana. Multiple dashboards and multiple charts in each based on the collected logs. Additionally the adjustment of some existing tools to improve on the logs.
- Multiple Retool configuration adjustments including migrations/upgrades and integrations with external systems like GitHub or security features like Single Sign On from Azure.
- Technical documentation and user guides writing, covering most common use cases and relevant building blocks. As well as guides about changing the existing configuration of the system.
- REST API design and implementation using .NET 6 using best practices on code maintainability, automation and testability.
- Data collection (scraping) processes design and implementation using c#, python and golang from external sources. This also includes the cleaning and import of the data.


## (08-2016 – 11-2022) Intel, Heredia, Costa Rica
### _Software Developer Engineer_

- Automated validation processes across multiple systems and services to speed delivery speed and quality through system tests implemented in c#. This allowed the team to find escapees while doing changes and stop releases to customers.
- Served as an enabler for people inside and outside the team/organization by helping them on activities that will benefit/improve their work, the department and Intel in general through meeting and discussion on new proposals, design activities for general purpose solutions, stakeholders, timelines definition and other management/client relevant decisions that will define the development activities for the team.
- Developed backend services to support front-end applications and automation scripts and their business needs using ASP.NET core and other technologies.
- Helped the adoption process from multiple teams in new systems so they can easily use the new development in less time than initially required. All this by creating and debugging client scripts that connect to the new systems and also solving questions from customers.
- Developed front-end capabilities using Angular technologies based on previous defined/discussed needs, set the definition of done and followed the process from initial implementation to final deployment.
- Given customer support that implies working with clients and solving their issues with the system and with the inputs provided.
- Designed software solutions end to end (from requirements gathering to production release). Some of the efforts were a new module in a legacy system, a new script or even a new service.
- Implemented Azure Dev-ops pipelines to automate releases to cloud infrastructure and scheduled tasks, validated them and certified that the process is working.
- Implementing hotfix and new capabilities in legacy tools to support day to day business needs. From errors found to features that were required due to business changes. Most of these features helped reduce an important amount of time in the end user activities.
- Redesigning and/or implementation of current legacy code to reduce the technical debt. Activities were from updating the framework to refactoring a set of classes.
Response to issues that block normal operations of the system in a microservice architecture, from errors triggered by the system itself to problems caused by changes in the platform where those technologies reside. Most of them required querying application insights from Azure.
- Resolution on automated validation processes of the tooling used that failed due to platform changes. For example, a E2E test project had problems because of the build pack used + disk size configured.
- Implemented ETL jobs for synchronizing data and reporting activities using SQL Server Integration Services and SQL server. Some of the efforts required adding extra Power BI development activities.
- Coordinated daily stand-up meetings for the team following agile methodologies.
- Managed business communication with stakeholder around the globe (USA, Israel, Asia, India, among others)
- Added improvements on existing SQL Queries that were slowing down tools normal operations, some of the enhancements were done by updating the existing code (stored procedure) but also fixes on the database structure (indexes, fragmentation, etc.)
- Helped on Visual Studio 2019 extension development activities, from refactors, new development and validations.
- Helping teammates on technical issues to speed up the team velocity.
- Troubleshoot client-side issues on the fly to eliminate roadblocks on their day-to-day activities by using existing knowledge and debugging.
- Adapting to constant organizational changes that implied adjustments on daily activities, technologies and processes.
- Test plans creation and execution using azure test plans.
- Driven tech shares with the team in order to help on the day to day activities.
- Planned migrations for different technologies: Net Framework system, Net Core, SQL, Windows platforms, among others.
