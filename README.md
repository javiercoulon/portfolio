# Profile 
Experienced software engineer passionate about helping businesses grow by solving complex problems and optimizing processes. I thrive on teamwork, believing that every member is critical to a successful product and that clear communication can overcome even the toughest challenges. I approach difficult problems with the mindset that they are challenging but not impossible, and I promote knowledge sharing, discipline, and mentorship as key drivers for building high-quality products.

Over the years, I have contributed to a wide range of projects — from narrowly defined scopes to ambiguous, evolving requirements — always striving to deliver the highest quality. I have also had the opportunity to teach classes and share my expertise with others, further demonstrating my commitment to knowledge sharing and professional development. This experience has helped me grow as a mentor and strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts effectively.

An active learner, I continually invest in my professional growth through certifications, learning paths, and self-study to stay ahead in the ever-changing tech landscape. I am open to learning from others, value constructive feedback, and adapt readily to meet organizational needs.

# Work Experience

## (11-2024 – Present) Central Bank of Costa Rica
### _Software Developer Engineer_

## (11-2022 – 11-2024) Growth Acceleration Partners
### _Software Developer Engineer_

- Code review for teammates in a wide variety of internal repositories.
- Created multiple python automation scripts for different purposes: generating new files, scanning directories and summarizing values as part of the data import processes.
- Deployed AWS infrastructure. For example ECS Tasks, new security groups, RDS databases and EKS workloads. This has been done using Atlantis, Helm, Terraform and other infrastructure as Code (IAC) techniques.
- Bug fixes and enhancements to new and existing developments. For example, one of the features was consuming a lot of bandwidth due to the images load process, so a simple technique like caching reduced this by almost 50 to 60%. It also applied in other situations with some query optimization and pagination techniques.
- During this time I have also worked in other application development efforts. For example one in the  platform named retool. I drove the implementation of a full content management system based on functional and nonfunctional requirements previously discussed. This effort included custom components that were required for very specific business needs. This was not limited to just implementation but also I  was in charge of the platform itself, updating and even enabling features like SSO.
- Worked in several observability features using Grafana and different data sources like Stackdriver and Loki. Once more, this was something I did not have any previous experience on this platform and even though I was able to quickly learn and provide high quality dashboards that are used by several people and are included in some alerting systems.
- Technical documentation and user guides writing, covering relevant use cases and building blocks. This has been primarily done through Jira but also some word documents and README.md files.
REST API implementation and maintenance using .NET6 (and migrated to .NET8 later on). All this following best practices on code maintainability and testability for new developments
- GitHub Actions’ creation to automate build processes, deployment processes and code quality checks.
- Data collection processes (web scraping) implementation using c#, python and golang from external sources.



## (08-2016 – 11-2022) Intel, Heredia, Costa Rica
### _Software Developer Engineer_

- Automated validation processes across multiple systems and services to speed delivery speed and quality through system tests implemented in c#. This allowed the team to find escapees while doing changes and stop releases to customers.
- Served as an enabler for people inside and outside the team/organization by helping them on activities that will benefit/improve their work, the department and Intel in general through meeting and discussion on new proposals, design activities for general purpose solutions, stakeholders, timelines definition and other management/client relevant decisions that will define the development activities for the team.
- Developed backend services to support front-end applications and automation scripts and their business needs using ASP.NET core and other technologies.
- Helped the adoption process from multiple teams in new systems so they can easily use the new development in less time than initially required. All this by creating and debugging client scripts that connect to the new systems and also solving questions from customers.
- Developed front-end capabilities using Angular technologies based on previous defined/discussed needs, set the definition of done and followed the process from initial implementation to final deployment.
- Given customer support that implies working with clients and solving their issues with the system and with the inputs provided.
- Designed software solutions end to end (from requirements gathering to production release). Some of the efforts were a new module in a legacy system, a new script or even a new service.
- Implemented Azure Dev-ops pipelines to automate releases to cloud infrastructure and scheduled tasks, validated them and certified that the process is working.
- Implementing hotfix and new capabilities in legacy tools to support day to day business needs. From errors found to features that were required due to business changes. Most of these features helped reduce an important amount of time in the end user activities.
- Redesigning and/or implementation of current legacy code to reduce the technical debt. Activities were from updating the framework to refactoring a set of classes.
Response to issues that block normal operations of the system in a microservice architecture, from errors triggered by the system itself to problems caused by changes in the platform where those technologies reside. Most of them required querying application insights from Azure.
- Resolution on automated validation processes of the tooling used that failed due to platform changes. For example, a E2E test project had problems because of the build pack used + disk size configured.
- Implemented ETL jobs for synchronizing data and reporting activities using SQL Server Integration Services and SQL server. Some of the efforts required adding extra Power BI development activities.
- Coordinated daily stand-up meetings for the team following agile methodologies.
- Managed business communication with stakeholder around the globe (USA, Israel, Asia, India, among others)
- Added improvements on existing SQL Queries that were slowing down tools normal operations, some of the enhancements were done by updating the existing code (stored procedure) but also fixes on the database structure (indexes, fragmentation, etc.)
- Helped on Visual Studio 2019 extension development activities, from refactors, new development and validations.
- Helping teammates on technical issues to speed up the team velocity.
- Troubleshoot client-side issues on the fly to eliminate roadblocks on their day-to-day activities by using existing knowledge and debugging.
- Adapting to constant organizational changes that implied adjustments on daily activities, technologies and processes.
- Test plans creation and execution using azure test plans.
- Driven tech shares with the team in order to help on the day to day activities.
- Planned migrations for different technologies: Net Framework system, Net Core, SQL, Windows platforms, among others.
